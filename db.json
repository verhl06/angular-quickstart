      "description": "The time spent on any item of the agenda will be in inverse proportion to the sum [of money] involved.\n\nPeople within an organization commonly or typically give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.\n\n    A.k.a. the bike-shed effect: an average person cannot understand a complex problem, so one assumes that those who work on it understand it. but everyone can visualize a cheap, simple bicycle shed, so planning one can result in endless discussions because everyone involved wants to add a touch and show personal contribution.\n\n    Ambiguity aversion: a preference for known risks over unknown risks.",
